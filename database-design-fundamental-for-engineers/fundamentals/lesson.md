## Database Properties

A database has the following properties:

1. **Representation of the Real World:** A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the mini-world or the universe of discourse (UoD). Any changes occurring in the mini-world are reflected in the database, making it a dynamic reflection of real-world events.

2. **Logically Coherent Collection of Data:** A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. It is not a random assortment of data but rather has a well-defined structure and purpose. For example, a list of names alone may not be considered a database, but when paired with corresponding addresses and phone numbers, it becomes an address book with meaningful information.

3. **Designed for a Specific Purpose:** A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. It caters to an intended group of users and serves specific applications of interest to these users. For instance, a university department might gather student GPA data to finalize the dean's honor list.

A database has an active relationship with events in the real world and caters to an audience interested in its contents. Users interact with the database through transactions, and the database must maintain reliability by promptly reflecting real-world changes.

### Examples of Databases

Databases can vary in size and complexity, ranging from small and simple to large and intricate systems. Here are some examples:

1. **Address Book Database:** This database might consist of a few hundred entries containing names, addresses, and phone numbers of contacts. It serves the purpose of organizing personal or business contacts.

2. **Social Media Company Database:** Social media platforms like Twitter maintain extensive databases with millions of users. The database tracks information about user relationships (followers/following), user-generated content (tweets, posts), and various other data required for the website's proper functioning. Due to the vast amount of data, such platforms require multiple databases to manage the dynamic and ever-changing information.

In the next lesson, we will explore the fundamental concepts behind a Database Management System (DBMS).
