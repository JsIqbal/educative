In ancient era of computers we used have file system database for organization which had many disadvantagees.

As we can see, data on the students is available to their respective departments, accounts section, hostel office, etc. Some of the data is common for all sections (like roll number, name, address and phone number of students). On the other hand, some of the data is exclusive to a particular section, such as hostel allotment number which is a part of the hostel office only.

File-Based System Disadvantages:

Data redundancy: Multiple copies of data lead to inefficiency and inconsistencies.
Data inconsistency: Inaccurate or mismatched data in different files causes errors.
Difficult data access: Locating specific data is tedious and time-consuming.
Security problems: Limited security measures expose data to risks.
Difficult concurrent access: Simultaneous access is challenging due to file locking.
Database systems offer solutions by centralizing data, ensuring consistency, enabling efficient access, enhancing security, and implementing concurrency control.
