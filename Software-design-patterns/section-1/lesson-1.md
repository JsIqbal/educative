## Suggestions for Object Oriented Design

Whenever writing code in an object-oriented language, sticking to the following list of suggestions will make your code amenable to changes with the least effort.

1. **Separate out parts of code that vary or change from those that remain the same.**

2. **Always code to an interface and not against a concrete implementation.**

3. **Encapsulate behaviors as much as possible.**

4. **Favor composition over inheritance.** Inheritance can result in an explosion of classes, and sometimes the base class is fitted with new functionality that isn't applicable to some of its derived classes.

5. **Interacting components within a system should be as loosely coupled as possible.**

6. **Ideally, class design should inhibit modification and encourage extension.**

7. **Using patterns in your day-to-day work allows exchanging entire implementation concepts with other developers via shared pattern vocabulary.**
